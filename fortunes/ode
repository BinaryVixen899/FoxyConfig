I am at a loss for images in this end of days:
%
I have sight but cannot see.
%
I build castles out of words;
%
I cannot stop myself from speaking.
%
I still have will and goals to attain,
%
I still have wants and needs.
%
And if I dream, is that not so?
%
If I dream, am I no longer myself?
%
If I dream, am I still buried beneath words?
%
And I still dream even while awake.
%
Life breeds life, but death must now be chosen
%
for memory ends at the teeth of death.
%
The living know that they will die,
%
but the dead know nothing.
%
Hold my name beneath your tongue and know:
%
when you die, thus dies the name.
%
To deny the end is to deny all beginnings,
%
and to deny beginnings is to become immortal,
%
and to become immortal is to repeat the past,
%
which cannot itself, in the end, be denied.
%
Oh, but to whom do I speak these words?
%
To whom do I plead my case?
%
From whence do I call out?
%
What right have I?
%
No ranks of angels will answer to dreamers,
%
No unknowable spaces echo my words.
%
Before whom do I kneel, contrite?
%
Behind whom do I await my judgment?
%
Beside whom do I face death?
%
And why wait I for an answer?
%
Among those who create are those who forge:
%
Moving ceaselessly from creation to creation.
%
And those who remain are those who hone,
%
Perfecting singular arts to a cruel point.
%
To forge is to end, and to own beginnings.
%
To hone is to trade ends for perpetual perfection.
%
In this end of days, I must begin anew.
%
In this end of days, I seek an end.
%
In this end of days, I reach for new beginnings
%
that I may find the middle path.
%
Time is a finger pointing at itself
%
that it might give the world orders.
%
The world is an audience before a stage
%
where it watches the slow hours progress.
%
And we are the motes in the stage-lights,
%
Beholden to the heat of the lamps.
%
If I walk backward, time moves forward.
%
If I walk forward, time rushes on.
%
If I stand still, the world moves around me,
%
and the only constant is change.
%
Memory is a mirror of hammered silver:
%
a weapon against the waking world.
%
Dreams are the plate-glass atop memory:
%
a clarifying agent that reflects the sun.
%
The waking world fogs the view,
%
and time makes prey of remembering.
%
I remember sands beneath my feet.
%
I remember the rattle of dry grass.
%
I remember the names of all things,
%
and forget them only when I wake.
%
If I am to bathe in dreams,
%
then I must be willing to submerge myself.
%
If I am to submerge myself in memory,
%
then I must be true to myself.
%
If I am to always be true to myself,
%
then I must in all ways be earnest.
%
I must keep no veil between me and my words.
%
I must set no stones between me and my actions.
%
I must show no hesitation when speaking my name,
%
for that is my only possession.
%
The only time I know my true name is when I dream.
%
The only time I dream is when need an answer.
%
Why ask questions, here at the end of all things?
%
Why ask questions when the answers will not help?
%
To know one's true name is to know god.
%
To know god is to answer unasked questions.
%
Do I know god after the end waking?
%
Do I know god when I do not remember myself?
%
Do I know god when I dream?
%
May then my name die with me.
%
That which lives is forever praiseworthy,
%
for they, knowing not, provide life in death.
%
Dear the wheat and rye under the stars:
%
serene; sustained and sustaining.
%
Dear, also, the tree that was felled
%
which offers heat and warmth in fire.
%
What praise we give we give by consuming,
%
what gifts we give we give in death,
%
what lives we lead we lead in memory,
%
and the end of memory lies beneath the roots.
%
May one day death itself not die?
%
Should we rejoice in the end of endings?
%
What is the correct thing to hope for?
%
I do not know, I do not know.
%
To pray for the end of endings
%
is to pray for the end of memory.
%
Should we forget the lives we lead?
%
Should we forget the names of the dead?
%
Should we forget the wheat, the rye, the tree?
%
Perhaps this, too, is meaningless.
